I work at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, focusing on the fields of automated
mathematical reasoning and interactive theorem proving. See [my CV]({{site.url}}/files/cv.pdf) for a list of my
publications, presentations, and drafts.

For my masters project, I developed (with Jeremy Avigad and Cody Roux) a heuristic procedure for
reasoning with real-valued inequalities. The procedure works on extensions of the language of real
closed fields including multiplication by rational constants and uninterpreted functions with
axiomatic constraints.

The source code for the project, and brief instructions to run it, is available on
[Github](https://github.com/avigad/polya). Our ITP paper project in some detail; my [MS
thesis]({{site.url}}/files/ms_thesis.pdf) goes into much more detail. You can also see the
[slides]({{site.url}}/files/ms_slides.pdf) for my thesis defense.

I am a contributor and maintainer of the [standard library](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)
for the [Lean theorem prover](http://leanprover.github.io), currently under development at Microsoft
Research.

In my [dissertation]({{site.url}}/files/dissertation.pdf), I describe a proof-producing version of my masters
project implemented in Lean. This development includes tools for automated linear arithmetic. I have
also implemented an [ad-hoc connection between Lean and Mathematica]({{site.url}}/leanmm), allowing the import
and verification of computer algebra results.

I am now a postdoc at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam on Jasmin Blanchette's
[Matryoshka](http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/) project. I am a collaborator on Blanchette's [Lean
Forward](https://lean-forward.github.io/) project and Thomas Hales' [Formal
Abstracts](https://formalabstracts.github.io/) project.

I am very interested in the use of proof assistants in mathematics education; Jeremy Avigad, Floris
van Doorn, and I have developed a [mathematical reasoning
textbook](http://avigad.github.io/logic_and_proof/) that incorporates Lean. My general interests
also include the philosophical and psychological aspects of mathematical reasoning. While my
published work is largely technical, I am curious about how developments in formal languages and
automated proof can shed light on traditional mathematical practice.
