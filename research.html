	<div id="about">
	<p>I work at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, focusing on the fields of automated mathematical reasoning and interactive theorem proving.<br><br>

	For my masters project, I developed (with Jeremy Avigad and Cody Roux) a heuristic procedure for reasoning with real-valued inequalities. The procedure works on extensions of the language of real closed fields including multiplication by rational constants and uninterpreted functions with axiomatic constraints. I presented the project at ITP in July 2014.<br><br>
	
	The source code for our project, and brief instructions to run it, is available on <a href="https://github.com/avigad/polya" target="_blank">Github</a>. Our paper in ITP (see below) describes the project in some detail; my <a href="files/ms_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">MS thesis</a> goes into much more detail. You can also see the <a href="files/ms_slides.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a> for my thesis defense.<br><br>
	
	I am helping develop the standard library for the <a href="http://leanprover.github.io" target="_blank">Lean theorem prover</a>, currently under development at Microsoft Research. Lean is a system similar to Coq, based on dependent type theory. It aims to bridge the gap between automated and interactive verification in mathematics and computer science. My contributions include parts of the algebraic hierarchy, the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/tree/master/library/data/real" target="_blank">construction of the reals</a>, the Frechet derivative and other components of the analysis theory, and some linear algebra. I am working toward verifying some results concerning <a href="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/annals-v157-n2-p09.pdf" target="_blank">sphere packings</a>.<br><br> 
	
	I am working toward implementing a proof-producing version of my masters project within Lean. This development will include tools for automated linear arithmetic. I have also implemented an ad-hoc connection between Lean and Mathematica, allowing the import and verification of computer algebra results.<br><br>

	My general interests also include the philosophical and psychological aspects of mathematical reasoning. While my published work is largely technical, I am curious about how developments in formal languages and automated proof can shed light on traditional mathematical practice.

					<div id="abstract3"> <p>Lean is a new proof environment being developed at Microsoft Research. Based on dependent type theory, Lean combines an efficient elaboration process with a powerful type class inference mechanism. We describe how these features have been used in the development of the standard library, and why they make Lean a good environment for general automated methods. Ultimately, Lean aims to bridge the gap between user-centric interactive theorem proving and machine-centric automated theorem proving. We also outline a novel automated procedure for proving inequalities over the real numbers that is currently being implemented. </p></div> <!--abstract3-->

						<p>Lean is a new proof assistant based on dependent type theory, being developed at Microsoft
Research and CMU. A powerful and efficient type class mechanism allows us to construct
and reason about the algebraic hierarchy and concrete number systems in a uniform, robust
way. In this talk, I will explain the implementation of algebraic structures and the real numbers
in Lean, and why this approach eases the development of further automation. I will
also describe Polya, an automated tool for verifying real-valued inequalities which is being
implemented in Lean. </div> <!--abstract4-->

					<div id="abstract4"> 
						<p>A proof assistant for mathematics should recognize relationships been algebraic structures and instances; for example, that every semigroup is a group, a ring extends both an additive group and a multiplicative monoid, and the integers are an instance of an ordered ring. Managing these relationships makes it possible to use definitions, theorems, and notation developed for semigroups, for example, when reasoning about arbitrary rings, and the integers in particular.<br><br>

We describe a way of accomplishing this, implemented in the Lean theorem prover. Lean is based on dependent type theory, and expressive foundational language in which every object has an associated "type". Lean supports a mechanism known as type class inference, which was originally designed to support generic programming in functional programming languages. I will explain how dependent type theory and type classes are ideally suited to managing the algebraic hierarchy as well.  </div> <!--abstract4-->
