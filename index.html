Lewis. I'm a postdoc in the department of Theoretical Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working with Jasmin Blanchette on the Matryoshka project.</p> <p>I completed my PhD in Pure and Applied Logic at Carnegie Mellon University, under the supervision of Jeremy Avigad. I earned an MS in Logic, Computation, and Methodology in 2014 and an MS in Mathematics in 2015, both from CMU. Previously, I earned a BA from Rice University with a double major in Mathematics and Philosophy, and taught geometry, pre-calculus, and AP calculus at St. Agnes Academy in Houston. </p> <p>My interests revolve around formal methods, logic, and the foundations of mathematics. I work on interactive theorem proving, formal verification, automated logical reasoning, and type theoretic foundations for mathematics. More details are available on my Research page.</p> <p>You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:r.y.lewis@vu.nl">r.y.lewis@vu.nl</a>, and you can find my cv <a href="https://robertylewis.com/files/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p> </div> </section> <section class="post-list"> <div class="container"> <h2>News and Updates</h2> <article class="post-item"> <p><span class="post-meta">Oct 7, 2020</span> — <strong><a class="post-link" href="/2020/witt-vectors/">Formalizing the Ring of Witt Vectors</a></strong> — <span> Johan Commelin and I have released a preprint of our new paper, Formalizing the Ring of Witt Vectors!
